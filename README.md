![Grades](https://github.com/ag-classrooms/autograding-r/actions/workflows/classroom.yml/badge.svg)

This repository works as a template for setting up Github Classroom assignments with autograding capabilities. It still has lots of opportunities for improvement. 

## Configuration

Most of the configuration is already here. But still there are lots of ways to improve upon this repo ðŸš§.

- The github classroom assigmnent *most* have enabled feedback pull requests. 
- Upon distribution to students, the badge (indicating a passing solution) in the `README` file is directed to:
  - the source template, if it is on the `main` branch. 
  - the student's solution, if it is on the `feedback` branch.
