Usually my assignments looks like this. First a setup block where libraries are
loaded. 

```{r setup}

renv::restore()

```

First, I ask students to write the solutions as functions. 

```{r first solution, purl = TRUE}
test <- function(nsamples){
    runif(nsamples)
}
```

Then, the students should see their functions work on a set of examples within 
the assignment. 

```{r}

hist(rnorm(10000))

```
